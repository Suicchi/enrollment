This is a simple project that can be deployed in a web server so that it can be used by schools to keep track of student information during the enrollment process. I was able to learn ASP.NET MVC as well as how to use PostgreSQL with it by doing this small project. 

Technologies used: ASP.NET MVC, PostgreSQL
